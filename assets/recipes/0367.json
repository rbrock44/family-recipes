   "instructions": "Dissolve yeast in water, set aside. In a sauce pan, combine milk, margarine and potatoes. Cook over low heat just until margarine is melted. Remove from heat. In a large bowl mix potato mixture, sugar, salt and 2 c. four. Add yeast mixture and eggs, mix well. Cover loosely and allow to stand for 2 hours. After 2 hours, stir in enough of the remaining flour to make a soft dough. Knead until smooth and elastic, about 6 minutes. Place in a bowl sprayed with Pam and spray top of dough with Pam. Cover and let rise until double, about 1 hour. Punch dough down and divide into thirds. Roll out each portion into a 12 inch circle. Cut into 12 pie shape wedges. Beginning at wide end, roll up. Place rolls on greased cookie sheets and let rise 30 minutes, or until doubled in size. Bake at 250째 for 15 to 20 minutes. Can be used for coffee cakes. Mix and divide into thirds as above. Roll out until about 1/2 inch thick, spread a fruit glaze over dough and roll up in jelly roll fashion. Place in a 9 inch pie plate with seam down, in a circle. Pinch edges together. Let rise until double in size. Bake at 350째 for 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool and then frost with icing.",
