   "instructions": "Peel apples and thinly slice. In a bowl, toss apple slices with 5 tablespoons sugar and cinnamon and let set while mixing other ingredients. Grease and flour a 10 inch tube pan or Bundt pan. Preheat oven to 350Â°. In a large bowl, mix together sugar, eggs, oil, vanilla. Beat well. Add dry ingredients; flour, salt, baking soda, baking powder. Mix thoroughly. Add orange juice. Blend for 1 minute on low speed, then increase speed to medium for 3 minutes. You will have a very thick batter. Fill prepared pan with alternating layers of batter and apple mixture, making a total of 3 batter layers and 2 apple layers. Start and finish with batter. (Be sure not to make apple layers too thick or cake will not hold together.) Bake for 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 hours or until knife comes out clean. Cool on rack for 10 minutes. Allow cake to cool completely on rack. Then invert cake and remove from pan.",
