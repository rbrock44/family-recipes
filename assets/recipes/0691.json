Mix well and bring to a boil over a medium heat, stirring often to make sure the sugar is dissolved before mixture reaches the boiling point. Continue to cook over a medium to high heat, stirring occasionally, until temperature reaches 236°. Remove saucepan containing mixture from heat and let stand until temperature of mixture cools to 180°. Add maple flavoring and begin to stir with a spoon and continue stirring until mixture becomes thicker and appears just a little lighter in color. Do not stir until mixture become too thick to pour.
