   "instructions": "Wash and mash the blackberries, or better, run them through a food chopper. Put the mixture in a stone crock and place it in a warm place so it ferments. Stir with a wooden spoon once or twice a day. In about 5 days remove the seeds and solids by passing it through a thin cloth. Dissolve sugar in warm water and add it to the blackberry juice in a 5 gallon jug. Add water to overflowing, over the opening of the jug with 3 or 4 big grape vine leaves, weighing them down with about 4 pounds of sand tied up in cloth. In 8 or 10 weeks the wine will be ready to enjoy. Fast fermentation improves the wine.",
