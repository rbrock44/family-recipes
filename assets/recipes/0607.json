   "instructions": "Heat oven to 375°. Beat eggs, vanilla, shortening and about 1⁄2 of the cake mix (dry) until light and fluffy. Stir in remaining cake mix, the chocolate chips and nuts. Drop dough by teaspoonfuls about 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheet. Bake 10 to 12 minutes at 375°. (Cookies will be soft in centers when done.) Cool slightly before removing from baking sheet. Makes about 5 dozen cookies. Our fami- ly favorite is to substitute peanut butter chips for the chocolate chips and use German Chocolate Cake Mix to make very good cookies. Suggested cake mixes: Yellow, Devil's Food, White, Butter Rec- ipe, Sour Cream, Chocolate Fudge, Chocolate Fudge Supreme.",
