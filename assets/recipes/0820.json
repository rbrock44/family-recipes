Place spices in a cheese cloth and tie with a string--a tea ball also works--and drop into the cider. Simmer for 20 minutes. Do not bring to a full boil. Serve hot.\nNote: Once made, you can pour it into a sanitary container and refrigerate. Then you can pour a cup at a time and heat it in your microwave.",
