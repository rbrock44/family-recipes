   "instructions": "Mix together in a bowl, yeast, warm water and 1 Tbsp. sugar. Place the bowl in a sink of warm water for 15 minutes or until mixture begins to bubble. Stir in remaining sugar, salt, oil and milk. Using an electric mixer, fold in 3 cups of flour. Mix well after each cup. Remain- ing flour can be folded in with a wooden spoon until mixture is no longer sticky. The dough will be heavy. Place dough on floured board. Divide dough in half. Spray coffee cans and lids with non-stick cooking spray. Put half of dough in each can and put the lids on. At this point, the cans can be placed in the freezer. For baking, set can in a warm place until the lid pops off. Take the lids off and bake at 350° for 45 minutes (or 325° convection for 30 minutes) or until golden brown and loaf slides out of can easily.",
