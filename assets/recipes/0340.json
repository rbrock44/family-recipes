   "instructions": "In large mixing bowl, combine 2 1?2 c. of the flour and the yeast. In saucepan, heat together the milk, butter or margarine, sugar, and salt just till warm (115° to 120°), stirring constantly till butter or margarine almost melts. Add liquid to dry ingredients in mixing bowl along with eggs. Beat at low speed of electric mixer for 2 minutes, scraping sides of bowl constantly. Beat 3 minutes at high speed. Stir in as much of the remaining flour as you can mix in with a spoon, Turn out onto a lightly floured pastry sheet. Knead in enough of the remaining flour to make a stiff dough that is smooth and elastic (6 to 8 minutes total). Divide dough into thirds. Shape each of two portions into loaves. Store in container with a double thickness of waxed paper between. Divide remaining dough into 16 portions. Shape each into a smooth ball. Arrange the 16 balls 1 inch apart in a cold cut keeper. Apply seal; freeze firm. To conserve on freezer space, transfer frozen ball to smaller container. When ready to bake, let dough rise until double in size. Bake at 375° until done. You can place dough in refrigerator to thaw overnight.",
