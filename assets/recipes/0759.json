   "instructions": "Combine flour, baking powder and salt. Cut in shortening. Add milk, vanilla and 1 1⁄2 cup brown sugar. This makes the dumplings. Drop by teaspoon into hot syrup. For hot syrup in 1 1⁄2 quart sauce pan, add 2 tablespoons shortening, 1 1⁄2 cup brown sugar, boiling water and 1/8 teaspoon salt. It is best to cook in a pan which has a fitted lid cover. A transparent cover is excellent for dumpling cooking. Boil syrup gently for five minutes. Add dumplings. Cook for 20 minutes without removing cover.",
