   "instructions": "In a 2 or 3 quart heavy saucepan, melt the butter or margarine over a low heat. Add the sugar and lecithin and stir constantly with a wooden spoon over a medium high heat, until mixture comes to a boil. Then add the corn syrup and continue to cook over a medium heat, stirring constantly to prevent burning in the bottom, until temperature reaches 295Â°. Remove from heat. To the cooked mixture, add salt and nut meats and gently mix in. Then pour into a well buttered shallow pan. Smooth out with a spatula or knife to a thickness of 1/4 inch. Before toffee sets and becomes firm, cut into rectangles using a knife. Toffee can also be left unscored and broken into irregular pieces after it sets. Toffee can be left uncovered or dipped in chocolate almond bark",
