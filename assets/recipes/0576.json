   "instructions": "Preheat oven to 350°. Mix crumbs and butter and press into 13 x 9 inch pan with greased sides. Pour sweetened condensed milk over crumbs. Sprinkle with peanut butter chips, chocolate chips and pea- nuts. Press peanuts gently into mixture. Bake 25 minutes or until edges are golden brown. I use less peanut butter chips (1 1⁄2 cups to 1 3/4 cups) and slightly more peanuts (1 1/4 cups to 1 1⁄2 cups). This is always better the next day.",
