Place a third layer of graham crackers on top of the pudding mixture. Chill in the refrigerator while making the topping. Mix and melt over low heat the baking chocolate, 4 tablespoons of milk and butter. Remove from heat and quickly add powdered sugar. Stir until smooth and pour over layer of graham crackers. Store in refrigerator. Best when made a day ahead so that the graham crackers can soften.",
