   "instructions": "Dissolve yeast in warm water. Combine boiling water and short- ening, blend well. Add sugar and salt. Stir until lukewarm. Blend in yeast, milk and eggs. Gradually stir in enough flour to make a soft dough. Turn onto lightly floured board. Knead until smooth and satiny (about 7 minutes). Place in lightly greased bowl, turnover to grease top. Cover. Let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 and 1 1/2 hours. Turn dough onto floured surface. Roll to 1/2 inch thickness. Cut into 8 x 11/2 inch strips. Fold in half, cross ends of stick over each other to form twist. Pinch to secure ends well. Cover, let rise 30 minutes. Fry in deep fat. Drain on paper towel. Roll in sugar.",
