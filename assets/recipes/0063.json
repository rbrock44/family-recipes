   "instructions": "Remove the fat from the meat and cut in 8 to 10 sections through the bone. Do not remove the bone, as this adds flaver. Peel the potatoes and slice one-third of them in thin slices. Leave the rest of the potatoes whole.\nInto a saucepan, put the thinly sliced potatoes, then a layer of sliced onions, and then the sections of lamb. Season well. Add the thyme and another layer of sliced onion. Cover with the remainder of the potatoes, which have been left whole. Season again and add 2 cups of water. Cover the pot with foil and with a very tight-fitting lid. (See note.)\nCook in 350° oven for 2 1⁄2 hours or simmer gently on top of the stove for the same time. The thinly sliced potatoes at the bottom of the pot should dissolve and thicken the juice, while the potatoes on top retain their shape and remain floury. This stew is very easy on the digestion.\nNote: In the old days in Ireland, the stew was first covered with a thick paste of flour and water to seal in the steam. Then the lid was placed on top. When the stew was cooked, the paste was thrown to the hens and the stew was eaten with great relish.",
