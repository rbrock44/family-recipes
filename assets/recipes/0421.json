   "instructions": "Place dried cherries or raisins in a bowl. Add enough boiling water to cover fruit. Let stand for 5 minutes; drain well. Sift together flour, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Using a pastry blender, cut in butter or margarine until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Toss cherries or raisins and orange peel with flour mixture. Make a well in center. Stir together sour cream and egg yolk. Add all at once to flour mixture. With a fork, stir until combined (mixture may seem dry.) Turn out onto lightly floured surface. Quickly knead by gently folding and pressing for 10 to 12 strokes or until dough is nearly smooth. Pat or lightly roll dough into a 7 inch circle. Cut into 12 wedges. Arrange 1 inch apart on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake in 400Â° oven for 10 to 12 minutes or until light brown. Cool on a wire rack 10 minutes. Drizzle with Orange Glaze. Serve warm.",
