   "instructions": "Cut biscuits into fourths. Roll in sugar and cinnamon mixture. (I use plastic bag to shake them in.) Place in ungreased Bundt pan. Bring to a boil, the butter and brown sugar. Add a little water to make syrup. Add remains of sugar and cinnamon mixture to syrup. Pour syrup over biscuits. Bake at 350Â° for 40 to 45 minutes. Note: You might want to place a piece of foil over pan after 15 minutes so it does not burn. Let cool 10 minutes. Turn over on plate. Great for breakfast while still warm. I have sprinkled nuts in pan along with biscuits.",
