   "instructions": "(Note: You may use all purpose (regular) flour, however biscuits will not rise as much and have a denser texture. Flavors should be about identical. Can substitute 3 packets of Sweet and Low for the sugar. Original recipe does not say, but I would think you will want to shred the cheese.)\nIn a 1 1‚ÅÑ2 quart mixing bowl, combine the milk, mayo, sugar, and flour. Beat on high speed with electric mixer for almost a minute, until smooth and completely combined. Using scraper streak the dough with the cheese. Batter should not be thin enough to pour, if necessary add only enough additional flour so batter will 'drop' from spoon. Drop batter into 10 paper lined muffin tins or a greater number of tiny muffin cups. Muffins tend to triple in size when baked. Fill lightly. Melt butter, mix in garlic and brush on top of dough after they are baked. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until golden. Cool in pan or rack and hot. for 30 minutes. These definitely should be served freshly baked and hot",
