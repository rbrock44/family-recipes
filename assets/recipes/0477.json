Put cake mix, eggs, water, pudding mix, and chocolate chips into pan; stir with a fork or spoon until blended, about 2 minutes. Scrape sides; spread batter evenly in pan. Bake 35 to 45 minutes, until tooth pick inserted near center comes out clean. Cooled cake may be sprinkled with pow- dered sugar. Use a knife to loosen cake from sides; cut and serve directly from pan. Store leftover cake loosely covered.\nVariation: Prepare pan as directed, using 1/4 cup oil. Add cake mix, 2 eggs, 1/2 cup water and 1 (20 to 23 ounce) can cherry pie filling. Mix, bake, and serve.",
