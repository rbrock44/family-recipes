   "instructions": "Dissolve yeast in lukewarm water. Let stand. Beat eggs and sug- ar together. Add milk, salt and oil to the egg mixture. Add the yeast mixture and flour to make a soft dough. Knead the dough. Place in greased bowl and let rise until double. Punch down and let rise again. Roll out dough into rectangle 14 x 8 inch. Place on greased heavy baking sheet. Spread fruit filling down center of dough covering space about 3 inches wide. At each side of filling, make cuts 2 inches apart and 2 inches long into dough. This makes 7 strips on each side. Take a strip on each side and cross them at center of the filling. Pull strips down, keeping ends inside. Continue to lace opposite strips, tucking last ends underneath. Cover with damp cloth and let rise until double. Bake until golden brown. Frost with favorite icing.",
