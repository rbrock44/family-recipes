On waxed paper, mix flour and paprika; use mixture to coat chicken pieces. In a 12-inch skillet over medium heat, in hot butter or marga- rine, cook chicken until browned on all sides. Add wine and bouillon. Reduce heat to low; cover and simmer 30 minutes or until fork-tender; remove the toothpicks. In cup, blend cornstarch and cream until smooth; gradually stir into skillet. Cook, stirring constantly, until thickened. Serve over chicken."
