Then add flour in two additions using the amount necessary to make dough easy to han- dle. Knead the dough. Place in greased bowl, turning once to bring greased side up. Cover with damp cloth and let rise until doubled. Shape into loaves and place in greased bread loaf pans. Let rise again and bake at 425Â° for 25 to 30 minutes. This basic dough can be used for nut, date or raisin bread.",
