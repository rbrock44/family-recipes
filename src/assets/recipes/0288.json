   "instructions": "Place partially thawed potatoes in a greased casserole dish. Mix next 7 ingredients and pour on top of potatoes. Sprinkle corn flakes and remaining butter on top. Bake at 350Â° for 45 minutes. Variations: You may use 5 cups boiled and cubed potatoes instead of hash browns. Some prefer 1 (8 ounce) carton sour cream instead of two. Others prefer using 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese in place of sour cream. This is a great potluck dish by adding 1 cup diced ham.",
