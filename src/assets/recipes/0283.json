   "instructions": "Simmer the onions in half the butter until soft, but not brown. Add the flour; cook 5 minutes, then add consomme, sour cream, Worcestershire sauce and Tabasco sauce. Continue cooking 10 min- utes longer over low heat. Slice potatoes thin and saute in remaining butter about 5 minutes. Trim fat from ham and cut ham into strips about 1 x 1/2-inch. Peel the pickles and slice very thin. Mix all ingredients with the onion sauce carefully, using a fork. Place all together in a 9 x 9-inch baking dish. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and bake at 350Â° for about 20 minutes to 1?2 hour. Good with cucumber salad and pumpernickel bread.",
