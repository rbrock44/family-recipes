   "instructions": "Scatter the pecan halves evenly on wax paper on a cookie sheet. Melt chocolate in top section of double boiler as required for hand dipping, then temper. For bark however, it is best to temper the melted chocolate in a bowl by stirring with a spoon or spatula, rather than working with the hand on a flat surface. Place about half of the melted chocolate in a bowl and let stand in a cool area. Cool chocolate down by stirring often until it is a little too cool and stiff to pour freely. Then bring the remainder of melted chocolate from the double boiler into the bowl of cool chocolate, and work constantly with a spoon or spatula until the entire batch of chocolate feels cool to the touch, but is yet in the free-flowing stage. The chocolate is now tempered and is ready for use. Pour over the scattered nuts and spread thin with a knife or spatula, let stand until chocolate sets, then break into irregular pieces. Any chocolate left over can be re-melted and used again. Also other nuts such as cashews, almonds, etc. can be used instead of pecans if desired.",
