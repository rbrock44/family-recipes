   "instructions": "Place butter and lemon juice in a 10 x 6 x 1 3/4 inch baking dish. Microwave on high for 15 to 30 seconds or until melted. Arrange fish pieces, thickest end toward outside, in baking dish. Sprinkle with lem- on pepper and seasoning salt. Cover with plastic wrap. Microwave on high for 4 1?2 to 6 minutes or until fish flakes easily with a fork. Halfway through cooking turn fish over and sprinkle with a little more lemon pepper and seasoning salt. Test For Doneness: Because overcooking tends to dry and tough- en fish, microwave for only the minimum cooking time, then check for doneness. Fish will turn from translucent to opaque and will flake eas- ily. The inner areas should still be slightly translucent. They will fin- ish cooking during a 5 minute standing time while the outer areas will remain tender.",
