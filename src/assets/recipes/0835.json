   "instructions": "Mix thoroughly. This makes enough to cure one whole ham or pork shoulder. Use half of this for a 4 to 6 pound pork roast. Put this around outside of ham or shoulder. Take a sharp knife and push down along side of bone. Force some of the cure along bone as well as you can. Wrap in paper bag, then wrap again in cheese cloth. Store in cool place, like bottom of refrigerator or outside if cold enough, until bag becomes wet. The salt is drawing the moisture out of meat. Let sit for six weeks, then slice and fry or bake as desired. This recipe has been passed on over many generations.",
