   "instructions": "Peel potatoes, cut in chunks, and boil until soft enough to mash. Drain. Mix with 3 Tbsp. margarine, salt and pepper to taste, and enough milk to make them just slightly runny. (Just a little more than if you were serving regular mashed potatoes.) Chop onions in small pieces and saute in 2 Tbsp. margarine. Add to potatoes and mix well. Stir in about 2/3 bag of Velveeta. (Use more if you like cheese.) Bake at 350Â° in 9 x 13 buttered pan for 20 to 30 minutes or until potatoes are bubbly. This recipe can be made ahead of time and frozen. Thaw before baking.",
