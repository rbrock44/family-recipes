   "instructions": "Grease well a 13 x 9 inch baking dish. Cut bread into 1 inch wide slices. Arrange slices in 1 layer, in bottom of pan. Beat eggs, milk, sugar, salt and vanilla in large bowl. When thoroughly mixed, pour over bread in pan. Bread will float on top of liquid. Cut each pat of butter into 4 pieces. Dot each piece of bread with a piece of butter. Sprinkle with cinnamon. Cover. Refrigerate overnight, or up to 36 hours. Place dish, uncovered, in cold oven. Turn oven temperature to 350° (325° if glass dish) and bake for 45 to 50 minutes or until bread is puffy and light brown. Remove from oven. Allow to set for 5 minutes. Bread will rise to top with a layer of custard on the bottom, similar to a bread pudding. Serve with syrup, sliced strawberries and dust with powdered sugar.",
