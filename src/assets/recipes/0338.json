   "instructions": "Dissolve yeast in warm water in large bowl. Let set for 5 minutes. Add sugar, shortening, egg, salt and 1/2 of the flour. Beat at low speed with mixer until smooth. Gradually stir, by hand, enough remaining flour to make a soft dough. Place dough in a well greased bowl, turning to grease top. Place covered in a warm place and let rise for 1 hour or until double in size. Punch down, turn out on a lightly floured board and knead 4 or 5 times. Shape into a loaf, place in a greased bread pan. Cover and let rise. Bake 20 minutes at 350Â° or until bread has a hollow sound when tapped. Remove from pan and cool on a wire rack.",
