   "instructions": "Drain zucchini well, pressing between layers of paper towel. Set aside. Beat eggs at medium speed with electric mixer until thick and pale. Gradually add sugar, beating well. Stir in grated zucchini. Combine flour and next 4 ingredients, gradually stir into zucchini mix- ture. Stir in pecans, raisins, and pineapple. Pour into 3 greased and floured 8 inch round cake pans. Bake at 325Â° for 35 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool in pans on wire racks for 10 min- utes. Remove from pans and cool completely on wire racks. Spread Pineapple Cream Cheese frosting between layers and on top of cake. The frosting is soft and recipe works better if sides of cake are left unfrosted. Cover and refrigerate.",
