   "instructions": "Wash cucumbers thoroughly and slice thinly, without peeling. Medium sized cucumbers about five inches long and about an inch in diameter are best. Peel onions and slice thinly. Mix cucumbers, onions, and salt. Use pure granulated salt (medium coarse). Add cracked ice and let stand 3 hours, then drain thoroughly. The ice and salt mixture helps make pickles especially crisp. Make the pickling solution and heat them to the boiling point.",
