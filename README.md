## ðŸ§  What's My Purpose?

This wesbite was created for my grandma (and family) to hold our family recipes. The benefit the website provides over a cookbook is quicker search access and the ability to easily change the number of batches.

<br/><br/>
To add a recipe use [Add Recipe](https://github.com/rbrock44/add-recipe)
